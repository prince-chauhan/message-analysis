# Sentiment Analysis

This is a simple sentiment analysis application that uses TensorFlow.js to classify text input as positive, negative, or neutral. The application consists of a simple HTML front-end for user input and result display, and a Node.js backend with an Express.js API for communicating with the TensorFlow.js model. The application also provides a confidence score for each sentiment prediction.

## Set up and run the application

- Clone this repository.
- Install Node.js and NPM on your machine.
- Navigate to the project root directory in the terminal.
- Install the necessary Node.js packages by running `npm install`.
- Start the backend server by running `npm start`.
- Open `localhost:3000` in a web browser.
- The application should now be running and ready to accept user input.

On the front-end,

- Edit `index.html` to change the content of the webpage
- `main.js` is the javacript that runs when you load the webpage
- Style tags are internally loaded in `index.html`

On the back-end,

- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
